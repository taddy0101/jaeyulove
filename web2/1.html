<h1>Greetings from 재유</h1>

hello world, my name is <strong>Jaeyu</strong>. for a long time of mundane work,
<br>I have decided break myself and start to explore and study <u>programming</u>.

<p>The only reason to study is stem from a pure curiosity
and its potential, thinking I might be able to create anything
from my head and it could be a business model.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">It is definately a risk and some might call it reckless,
   considering my irrelevant career and age.
However, I also think this is the right time to jump on and see how far I can go.</p>
