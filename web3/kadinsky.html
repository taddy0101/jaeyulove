<strong>Wassily Kandinsky</strong>, Russian in full Vasily Vasilyevich Kandinsky,
(born December 4 [December 16, New Style],
1866, Moscow, Russia—died December 13, 1944, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France).<br><p>
Russian-born artist, one of the first creators of pure abstraction in modern painting.
<br>After successful avant-garde exhibitions,
he founded the influential Munich group Der Blaue Reiter
(“The Blue Rider”; 1911–14) and began completely abstract painting.

<br>His forms evolved from fluid and organic to geometric and, finally,
to pictographic <br>(e.g., Tempered Élan, 1944).
